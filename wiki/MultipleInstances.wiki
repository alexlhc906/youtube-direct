==Configuring !YouTube Direct's Multi-Instance Mode==

===Introduction===

As of the 3.0 release, !YouTube Direct supports multiple, logically separated instances to be served out of a single App Engine deployment. Each logical instance has its own configuration, set of administrators, and potentially its own custom UI.

While this functionality isn't for everyone, we envision service providers, agencies or consultants being able to deploy a single App Engine app and then set up multiple logical instances to handle different client deployments.

===Technical Details===

Multi-instance mode relies on App Engine's support for [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/multitenancy/multitenancy.html namespaces and multitenancy]. A filter is defined in a special `web.xml` configuration file that automatically applies the correct namespace to a given incoming HTTP request.

===Configuration Steps===

  # Ensure that you're starting with an up to date codebase. Either [http://code.google.com/p/youtube-direct/downloads/list download] a 3.0 (or higher) `tar.gz` archive or sync to the [http://code.google.com/p/youtube-direct/source/checkout SVN trunk] using an SVN client of your choice.
  # Rename the `web.xml` file (in the `war/WEB-INF/` directory of the downloaded code) to something else, like `web_ORIGINAL.xml`.
  # Rename the existing `web_INSTANCES.xml` file (in the same `war/WEB-INF` directory) to `web.xml`.
  # Follow the normal !YouTube Direct deployment and configuration process, as outlined in the GettingStarted guide.
